I've been wanting to get into TypeScript, but...
<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>my company doesn't like big change.</li>
    <li>my project is too big to add something like that.</li>
    <li>I'm scared</li>

Some good, most not.

### So how do I get started with TypeScript?
1) [Create React App with TypeScript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript)
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
cd my-app
npm start

# or with yarn
yarn create react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
cd my-app
yarn start
```
```notes
* So how do I get into TypeScript
* Well you could use the no config CRA with TS
```
